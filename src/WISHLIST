IPTSTATE WISHLIST
This is the wishlist. READ IT BEFORE EMAILING ME.

Features coming soon:
- Filtering hostnames
- Inverse filtering
- Display NAT'd IP
- IPV6 support

Features that may come later:
- Secondary sorting
- Display packets/bytes per interval instead of just total
- Display the "CONNMARK" value of each connection

Features I probably won't add because I'm not that interested, or 
don't feel they belong, or would be too much work, or some
combination therein.
- Full regex filtering
