IPTState Bugs

KNOWN BUGS
None*

* There are no known bugs in the iptstate code at the time of this writing.
However, there are bugs in other pieces of software that may affect your
iptstate experience:

 - libnetfilter_conntrack 0.0.50 has a bug that prevents iptstate from
deleting ICMP states. I wrote the following patch which the netfilter folks
have already applied to their SVN tree:
  http://www.phildev.net/linux/patches/libnetfilter_conntrack-0.0.50_icmp_id.patch
You can use it if this affects you.

 - There seems to be a small memory leak somewhere in ncurses. See 
  http://www.phildev.net/iptstate/memleak.html
for details.  This won't effect most users much, but you want to be weary of
leaving iptstate running on very busy firewalls for very long periods of time
(a day or more). This bug has been reported to ncurses, see above URL.

ABOUT BUGS
If you find a bug in IPTState you should file a bug at our bugtracker:
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=52748&atid=467897
OR mail our -devel list:
  https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/iptstate-devel
OR email me at phil AT ipom DOT com.

Sending a bug to your distro or some public forum is not going to let me know.
I can't fix things I don't know about. So make sure I know!

ABOUT MY RESPONSE
If your bug is serious - i.e. compilation errors, a major a functionality is
broken, or a security problem I'll usually give you pretty immediate attention.
If it's a very minor bug, or a feature request, I'll respond as I have time.

ABOUT PATCHES
Patches are not necessary, but if you submit one remember: PATCHES SHOULD BE
ACCOMPANIED BY EXPLINATIONS AND/OR BUG REPORTS! Let me know what you were
trying to fix/add and how you did it. This will save me a lot of time, and I'll
like you more.

ABOUT BUG REPORTS
If you send me a bug report you MUST do the following:
  - Include "IPTSTATE" in the subject
  - Include your iptstate version
  - Include your distribution and distribution version
  - Include your kernel version
  - Include your g++ version
  - Include your make version
  - Include your glibc version
  - Include your ncurses version
  - Include your libnetfilter_conntrack version
  - Include any relevant output and/or errors

Bug reports should be sent to *ME* (see above). I cannot fix your bugs if you
don't tell *ME* about them. That's right, send your bug reports to *ME*.

Thanks!
